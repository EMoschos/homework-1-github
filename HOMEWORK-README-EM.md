# What i Understood about refactoring

The homework project required us to refactor the worked completed for "horiseon".  I understood it as making the webpage code more semantic and efficient without making major changes to the overall look.

# What I tried to achieve during the homework project

I followed the acceptance criteria and tried to make sure i addressed each of those issues

I wanted to leave the webpage essentially the same without any major changes in font, colors, pictures, etc.  I focused on making the CSS cleaner and removing un-needed class selectors or combining them under a tag selector, this allowed the removal of CSS selectors inside the tags, making the HTML look less bloated but still achieving the styling required.

I also tried to make the html document flow semantically by including headers, footers, main and aside tags.  I went with the <main> tag because its description fitted better than the <article> tag. It was items such as this that had me researching what is best fit for this project.  

# Project Outcome

I believe that i hit all the requirements set out in the README.md file related to acceptance criteria, but a lot more could be done around color contrasts, more accessible to screen readers etc.  however the main point i focused on was making sure each acceptance criteria was ticked.
